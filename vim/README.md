# My Vim configuration 
- I also have a detailed [Emacs](<https://github.com/marinov98/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/>) configuration guide with evil-mode
- If you are using vim inside [VS Code](https://github.com/marinov98/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json) I have a configuration for that as well that tries to match the one I have for vim in terms of custom keybindings.
